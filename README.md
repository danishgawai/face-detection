# face-detection
In this code we will try to detect faces with names
data set can be found in kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/5-celebrity-faces-dataset
here we try to achieve maximum accuracy with limited data 
it is not easy achieve high accuracy with such little data 
later we will also try transfer learning to achieve higher accuracy with same data
by transfering learned data from facenet or imagenet.
